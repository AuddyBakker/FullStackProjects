      Boyet, who accompanies the Princess, notices the King's affection for her, the Princess and entourage now plotting to punish the King and company. Don Armado meanwhile, decides to overturn Costard's punishment if he will only send a letter to Jacquenetta. Unfortunately, the fool bumps into Berowne who also wants the fool to send a letter, this time to Rosaline, part of the Princess' entourage, whom Berowne loves. Naturally Costard mixes the two letters up, Jacquenetta receiving Berowne's <span>letter for Rosaline</span> and Rosaline receiving Don Armado's letter for Jacquenetta. Meanwhile in the court, the King and company's resolve to shun the charms of women is rapidly falling to pieces.... Berowne, torn by his love for Rosaline, spies King Ferdinand writing a love letter to the Princess. Shortly thereafter, the King and Berowne spy Longaville writing a love letter to Maria, then King, Berowne and Longaville all catch Dumaine writing a love letter to Katherine. Naturally King Ferdinand tells off Longaville and Dumaine but the jig is soon up when Berowne tells off everyone else for breaking their vows unlike him. Unfortunately at this point Jaquenetta comes forward, revealing even Berowne broke his vow!
